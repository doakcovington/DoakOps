# Howdy

My name is Doak, and welcome to DoakOps.

DoakOps was the name I gave to an Azure DevOps development environment when I started working as a Software Engineer in 2021. Before that, I worked in Public Health at a Community Health Clinic.

I started in Software after attending a self-paced coding bootcamp with lots of self-learning. Like most developers, Iâ€™m horrible at naming things (there are too many DoakOps_x living on some Microsoft server), but I hope you enjoy this not-so-horribly-named site.

## Find Me:

- [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doakcovington/)

So, there you have it... enjoy!
